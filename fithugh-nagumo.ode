# Prompt: Do you know Bard Ermentrout's xppaut ode solver?
# 
# ChatGPT:
# 
# Yes, I'm familiar with the XPPAUT software developed by Bard
# Ermentrout. XPPAUT is a tool for simulating dynamical systems described by
# ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It provides an interface for the
# user to define the equations, specify initial conditions and parameters,
# and solve the system numerically.
# 
# XPPAUT includes a wide range of features such as bifurcation
# analysis, time series analysis, phase plane analysis, and fast Fourier
# transforms. It also has the ability to generate graphs and animations
# to visualize the results of the simulations.
# 
# Overall, XPPAUT is a powerful and versatile tool for studying dynamical
# systems, and has been used extensively in the fields of biology, physics,
# and engineering.

# Fitzhugh-Nagumo Oscillator
# dx/dt = -y + x - x^3
# dy/dt = (1/epsilon)*(x + a - b*y)

# Define the variables and parameters
x = -1.5, 1.5, -1, 1, 0.1
y = -0.5, 1.5, -0.5, 1.5, 0.1
a = 0.7
b = 0.8
epsilon = 0.01

# Define the ODE system
xdot = -y + x - x^3
ydot = (1/epsilon)*(x + a - b*y)

# Define the initial conditions
init = -1.2, 0.5

# Set the simulation parameters
tstep = 0.01
tmax = 50

# Set up the phase plot
