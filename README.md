## Generating session dump in HTML or Github MD

You can ask ChatGPT to generate an HTML or Github MD source code dump!
* Can you convert our conversation so far into HTML format, with embedded CSS code?
* Please generate such html code for our last discussion on pandas dataframe vector to matrix transform. Please give me the full code.
* Can you convert it to github md format?
* Can you show the source code for the md content so that the raw text is shown, not the rendered version?

## ChatGPT prompts and programs generated by ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Just for fun!

I got OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate some short and useful programs. The prompt used are included at the top of each program.

* [gaussian.py](gaussian.py) : animated sampling from 2D normal distribution
* [gaussian2.py](gaussian2.py) : same as above, but closer to what I intended
* [pickpixek.py](pickpixel.py) : click on image and report pixel coordinate
* [timestamp.gs](timestamp.gs) : Google doc app script to insert timestamp into the document.

Here's an example:
