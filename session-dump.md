To transform a 12x1 vector into a 3x4 matrix in a pandas dataframe, you can use the `pandas.DataFrame.values` attribute to access the underlying numpy array representation of the data in the dataframe, and then use the `numpy.ndarray.reshape()` method to specify the desired dimensions of the matrix and automatically rearrange the data in the vector to fit the new shape. The resulting matrix can then be converted back into a pandas dataframe using the `pandas.DataFrame()` constructor.

Here is an example of the code that you could use to do this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas dataframe containing the 12x1 vector
vec = pd.DataFrame([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12])

# Transform the vector into a 3x4 matrix using the reshape() method
matrix = vec.values.reshape(3, 4)

# Convert the matrix array back into a pandas dataframe
matrix_df = pd.DataFrame(matrix)

# Print the resulting matrix
print(matrix_df)
